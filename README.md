## Description

Provide a short description explaining the what, why, and how of your project. Use the following questions as a guide:

The motivation of this project is to help people to visually interact and learn how to sell and buy stocks. 
This application is for those who are indecisive about their stock market purchases and sells or who are looking to learn, they will have a useful application to give advice daily, visually.
It allows the user to view a visual representation of what constitutes a good time to purchase and/or sell stocks based on their stock market portfolio.
We learned how to save items to local storage and display them on a webpage. We also learned how to harness the capabilities of 2 API's for one web application.


## Installation

Utilized the API: 'https://data.alpaca.markets/v1beta1' and 'Unsplash.com' in order to pull data for each users selection of stocks. Utilize CSS and HTML to set the base of the application. Use Javascript and jQuery to support the functionality of the application and display the visual for the user. 

## Usage

Badges aren't necessary, per se, but they demonstrate street cred. Badges let other developers know that you know what you're doing. Check out the badges hosted by [shields.io](https://shields.io/). You may not understand what they all represent now, but you will in time.

## Features

The features of this application include 3 stocks on the rise and three stocks on the fall for the day. It offers a space for notes on the stocks rendered for the user as well as a visual representation of those stocks.
